What broke, what I got wrong, and what I did about it. Written as it happens.

## Editable install before the package existed

**What broke:** `uv pip install -e .` ran cleanly, then `import allocation_agent`
failed with `ModuleNotFoundError`. The install had reported success.

**Root cause:** hatchling resolves `packages = ["src/allocation_agent"]` at install
time. The directory was created *after* the install, so hatchling recorded an
empty package and exited 0. A successful exit code meant nothing here.

**Fix:** create the package tree and `__init__.py` files first, then install.

**Kept because:** a zero exit code is not evidence that a thing worked. The same
mistake in the reconciliation pipeline would be a run that "succeeds" having
matched nothing.

## Leakage guard: case sensitivity

**Caught before it shipped.** The first version compared column names exactly.
Column casing varies between sources — a bank export may well ship `MATCHRULE`.
An exact-match guard would have passed it and every downstream metric would have
been fiction.

**Fix:** case-insensitive comparison, and the error names *every* offending
column rather than the first.

## Derived-leak check found nothing — recorded as a negative result

Ran the mutual-information check over the 26 remaining columns on a 20,000-row
sample after dropping the four known outcome columns. Nothing above NMI 0.95.

Worth writing down: it confirms the four known columns were the only leaks,
rather than leaving that as an assumption. A negative result checked is worth
more than a positive result assumed.
